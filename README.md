### Project Title
The title of this project is 'Explore US Bikeshare Data'

### Description
The purpose for this project was to code with Python a script that uses raw inputs from a user for an interactive experience with existing Data. In our example it was a script for calculation with Bike Share Data.
I also coded some easter eggs in this script and the user can choose, if he would like to interact with this little easter eggs or not.  
So for this project the users choose between 3 given cities of the US like Chicago, Washington oder NYC.
He / she can choose to use special filters like a filter for a special month or a special day during the week.
Before the calculation start the user can get a preview of the chosen and filtered data.

With this given Data the calculation starts and show the user the following results:
1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

2) Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3) Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

4) User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Credits
Cheers to this great Udacity program, that learned me such so much for my new job as an Data Scientist.
Greeting also goes out to the reviewers and mentors for their time to give me always really good feedback or helped me with admin-bugs on my working laptop for example.

I will definitely recommend this program to all my work colleagues and friends.
